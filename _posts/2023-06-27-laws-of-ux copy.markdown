<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">D</span>esign is such a vast field that every person has its own perspective related to it. Every individual views it differently. Every individual has a different meaning associated with it.</p>

I came across a resource - [HackDesign](https://hackdesign.org/) from Gauravjeet (panda), one of the team members here at Ryaz. I found it a one-stop theoratical resource where I can find all about design - the principles, the practical approach, the disciplines and a lot more. It's finely put-out together with different & interesting articles from various authors.

Let's dive into the Week 0 of the course.

### Lesson 0

The Week 0 was about a documentary film called "The Objectified" that changed the very purpose & perspective of me studying this area of design. It demonstartes how each and every thing around us a particular design & how that design's important for it to be the way it is! It showed examples from the chairs, the toothbrushes to the design of the macbooks and many more.

It just kinda opened the eyes to the world of design. And was a perfect start for this journey!

### Lesson 1 - What is design? Why is it important?

The main idea behind this lesson is to tell that there's no particular approach to make beautiful designs. We need to make them such that the users find it convenient to use & it serves their purpose, no matter the approach we use. Like yes there are certain best approaches that can be used. But in the end, what matters is the user satisfaction.

#### Startups, This is How Design Works

- Often good designs are the ones that seem to be not designed at all.
- Dieter Rams’(a German Industrial Designer) shares his 10 principles of Good Design
  - innovative
  - makes a product useful
  - aesthetic
  - makes a product understandable
  - unobtrusive
  - honest
  - long-lasting
  - thorough
  - environment-friendly
  - minimal (as little design as possible)
- Different kinds of designs
  - Graphic Design
    - Print Design
  - Interaction Design
    - UI Design
    - UX Design
  - Industrial Design

### Making the Transition from Development to Design

This is guide that tells a person who's shifting from being a developer to a designer.
The main thing to understand is that we donot need to mentally separate design & development. When we create wireframes, we imply the code to be written. When we code it, we are basically actualizing the UX.

Tips are as follows:

#### Donot stop building things

We shouldn't stop developing stuff. Both the things are related to eachother & require understanding of each part of the software. _Ultimately, the real goal is to see no difference between your development and design skills. The skills gained from each focus are connected, interdependent and equally important towards making good software._

#### Learn design in order of dependency

The process of easing out the learning journey can be done by the division as follows:

1. Design for the reliability
2. Design for speed
3. Design for organization
4. Design for order & structure
5. Design for interaction
6. Design for aesthetics

#### Design everything you do

Designing everything we do in our real life - communicating, organising things in our room, and many more.
We need to make a habit of designing everything we do because designing requires a constant practice.

#### Care about your audience

This is important and can be a driving force to give our 100% in the design tasks. Even if the project doesn't interest you, we need to think about its impact on the users and then design the product according to the user needs without any compromise.

#### Talk about design and listen even more

Attending design events, meetups & listening to design podcasts can help a lot to understand the design.

#### Learn to write, then learn to speak

Writing down the thinking about the design principles as I'm doing rn via this blog, can help us understand better those concepts.

Further, speaking about our design/ the thinking behind our designs is as important as the design itself.

#### Focus on defining and solving problems

Now we need to identify the problems, the user wants and then define the problems clearly & work on solving them. Paying attention on the aesthetics alone wouldn't serve the purpose.

#### Listen to your gut, but trust your brain

We can focus on the ongoing trends or follow our instincts to create something new.

_It’s not bad to follow your instincts, but always follow up to understand why you did it in the first place. “Because it felt right” is a fine way to start a conversation, but not a good way to end one.“Because it felt right” is a fine way to start a conversation, but not a good way to end one._

#### Be your biggest critic

We need to keep on improving our design, updating our practices and sense when we are being too easy on ourselves.

#### Learn from the time-tested—and emulate it

We need to learn from the evergreen products in the market and focus on the things or the thining behind their timeless development.

#### Ideate romantically, create pragmatically

A balance of both is important.

_Our ideas should be bigger than reality, but our execution should be married to it._

Conclusion (some noteworthy lines from the conclusion abstract)
_Designers who understand and can work with code are becoming the prototype. A lot of your shift is about understanding that you have already been creatively solving problems as a developer, and that a lot of that thinking is universal._

### We’re Not Unhappy, We’re Designers

_Discontented observationalism is the designer’s modus operandi._ - it's the way the designers work. Continuous criticism, the urget to improve design, observing the details are some of the personality traits of a designer.

### Complete Beginner’s Guide to Interaction Design

_Interaction Design (IxD) defines the structure and behavior of interactive systems. Interaction designers strive to create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use, from computers to mobile devices to appliances and beyond. Our practices are evolving with the world._

One of the keys to user satisfaction is mastering the area of interaction design.

Various methodologies used by the interaction designers are:

#### Goal-Driven Design

The steps are as follows:

1. Design first, program second - We need to take care of the technical considerations afterwards, first we need to focus on the design.
2. Separate responsibility for design from responsibility for programming.
3. Hold designers responsible for product quality and user satisfaction. (the Interaction Designers)
4. Define one specific user for your product (user research)
5. Work in teams of tow - Communication is the key.

#### Usability

1st Set

1. Learnability: The ease with which the user is learning the interface
2. Flexibility: The ways in which th euser can interact with the system
3. Robustness: Support given when a user encounters an error

2nd Set

1. Learnability: The ease with which the user is learning the interface
2. Efficiency: The time it takes & the ease with which a user performs the tasks
3. Memorability: if a user hasn’t visited the system in a while, how well will they remember the interface?
4. Errors: the kind of errors made & how can the user overcome those?
5. Satisfaction: The software being according to their expectations & working well.

3rd Set

1. Learnability: The ease with which the user is learning the interface
2. Understandability: The understandability of the interface
3. Operability: how much control does the user have within the interface?
4. Attractiveness: whether the appearance of the app is visually appealing
5. Usability compliance: does the interface adhere to standards?->IMP

#### The Five Dimensions

(taken exactly from the resource)

1. 1D: words should be simple to understand, and written in such a way that they communicate information easily to the end user.
2. 2D: visual representations are all graphics or images, essentially everything that is not text. They should be used in moderation, so as to not overwhelm.
3. 3D: physical objects or space refers to the physical hardware, whether it’s a mouse and keyboard, or a mobile device a user interacts with.
4. 4D: time is the length that the user spends interacting with the first three dimensions. It includes the ways in which the user might measure progress, as well as sound and animation.
5. 5D: behavior was added by Kevin Silver in his article, What Puts the Design in Interaction Design. It is the emotions and reactions that the user has when interacting with the system.

#### Cognitive Psychology

Tells us about how the user thinks. (taken exactly from the resource)

We need to focus on the following:

1. Mental models are the images in a user’s mind that inform their expectation of a certain interaction or system. By learning the user’s mental model, interaction designers can create systems that feel intuitive.
2. Interface metaphors make use of known actions to lead users to new actions. For example, the trash icon on most computers resembles a physical trash can, in order to alert a user to the expected action.
3. Affordances are things that are not only designed to do something, but that are designed to look like they are designed to do something. A button that looks like a physical object you can push, for example, is an affordance designed so that someone unfamiliar with the button will still understand how to interact with it.

#### Human Interface Guidelines

Lastly, we can focus on these guidelines & take inspiration form existing systems.

#### Daily Tasks and Deliverables

On a regular note, we need to do the following-

1. Develop a design strategy
2. Craete wireframes for key interaction
3. Develop prototypes
4. Stay Current!

Finally, in the last article a link to a repo is shared that provides some outstanding typefaces with the examples of using them beautifully together.

That's it for this lesson.

See ya!
